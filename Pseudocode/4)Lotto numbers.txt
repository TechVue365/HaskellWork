User inputs a list of 6 numbers.
A variable stores the list as lottonums.
We then create a random generator for nums within a certain number range e.g 1 to 32.This would give an output of 6 winning numbers.Which we then store into a next variable named win_nums.
We then try and use a match function to determine if the numbers the user inputted matches the winning numbers generated. 
If lottonums==win_nums
return win
else
return lose
We then print if the user has won or has lost.
